I'm a software engineer professional with a variety of experiences in building automation tools that simplify business processes, enhance business technical operations and integrating systems. I also passionately educate and advocate for developers of tomorrow by teaching folx interested into transitioning into the tech space. 

Education
======
I attended Norfolk State University (NSU) of Norfolk, Virginia where I studied Computer Science with a focus in Computer Engineering for my undergraduate studies. During my Junior and Senior year, I was granted an opportunity as a Co-Op student for Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS) where I was able to experience multiple areas of technology that included Business Analysis and System Administration. After graduating with my Bachelor's of Science degree, I decided to continue my education by pursuing a Master's of Science in Electronics Engineering with a focus in Computer Engineering. I continued to work at NNS during my graduate studies, when I discovered I had a real passion for software development/engineering.
